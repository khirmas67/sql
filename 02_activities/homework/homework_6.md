**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

The Previou work using SQL has focused on analyzing data related to purchases such as fruits and vegetables, a field that may seem unrelated to ethical issues and inequality directly. However, this type of analysis can be modified to include these components in ways that contribute to greater ethical understanding and justice.

Ethical components can be embodied in how we use data. For example, when dealing with purchase data, consumer privacy should be considered. Mechanisms to protect personal identity such as data masking techniques or not tracing purchases to specific individuals without explicit permission can be implemented, especially when dealing with sensitive data related to dietary and health habits.

Inequality can appear in the distribution of food products or opportunities to access certain foods, which may vary across regions or neighborhoods. Using SQL, analyses can be conducted that highlight geographic or economic disparities in the distribution of fruits and vegetables. For example, queries can be made about the unequal distribution of fresh produce between rich and poor neighborhoods, helping to identify food gaps that affect vulnerable groups.

Adding these components to SQL queries can provide deeper, more human insight into the analysis, and help provide more equitable and inclusive solutions to public policies or business strategies that deal with food and consumers.
